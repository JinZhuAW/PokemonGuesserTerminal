# PokemonGuessingGame
A small game that let the user guess the name of any pokemon base on the image showing on the Terminal Window

Pre-install: Please install Terminal Image Viewer(tiv) before running the game.

Issue:
  Due to the tiv only works on Linux and MacOS, so it won't work on other systems. 
  The game is only being tested on Ubantu 20.04 LTS.
